            <img src="images/hicksLaw.PNG" alt="An example of Hicks law">
            <p class="paragraph"> The Disney Plus website is a wonderful example of Hick's law because it supplies us
                with so many options of movies.
                Hick's law is that the more options humans are provided the longer it takes for us to choose. We have
                all found ourselves scrolling
                through netflix, hulu, or disney plus looking for the best option for our evening movie watching. The
                beauty of the many options on this website
                is that it entices users to come back and watch all the movies at some time even if it isn't this
                time.</p>

            <img src="images/alignment.PNG" alt="An example of alignment">
            <p class="paragraph"> This website, visited by many is a prime example of alignment. As you scroll
                everything is
                aligned vertically and horizontally in an appealing way. specifically when provided the opportunity,
                users can scroll left to right to view apparel options
                (this being an example of horizontal alignment. and as they scroll up and down the page everything (upon
                loading the screen) is aligned vertically and centered well on the screen. It is important to notice that their
                taskbar was not modified for a viewport size like the one we are viewing.</p>

        <img src="images/visualHierarchy.PNG" alt="An example of Visual Hierarchy" class="large">
        <p class="paragraph"> The website of our church is a wonderful example of visual hierarchy(VH) because the first
            items, links, pictures, and videos that we see on the page upon loading
            are what the church has deemed to be of most import to those visiting the site. Furthermore, as the
            churches' website can be viewed based on region we see regional directives,
            discourses and advisement's placed in order of importance following the VH style.
